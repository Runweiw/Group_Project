# Some Tips for Peer Reviewers ðŸ‘»

Hi! This is the repo of Stats 506 group project, group 7. If you are going to review our draft version of the tutorial,
you may need to read the following html documents:

(1). Project_introduction.html;

(2). [Stata]_fmm_SongkaiXue.html;

(3). [R]_mixtools_RunweiWang.html;

(4). [R]_flexmix_LingkeYinig.html.

It will be helpful to read (1) first in order to get a general idea of the project. Then you are free to read (2), (3),
and (4) in any order as you like.

Thank you for reviewing our work:)

Best regards,\
